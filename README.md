# McD-Analysis
This Google Colab is an analysis on one of the biggest fast food chains running in the world. 
Every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, drinks, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts, has its nutrition information analyzed in this dataset.
Using some of the libraries from Python such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, I have used different ways to visualise data which summarizes items having highest calorie count from each category.
